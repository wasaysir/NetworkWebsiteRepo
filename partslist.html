The Download speeds are around 300 Mbps which is very fast and will allow all the devices to be running at full capacity with minimal lag or buffering.

            <img id="myImg4" src="assets/Pics/pic4.png" alt="Switch: This option provides more than enough ethernet ports to connect as many network devices as possible while providing the fastest connections. This allows us to connect to many more ethernet devices if more laptops were to come or if future devices require an ethernet connection. This switch supports the 300 Mbps transfer speed of our router, so it wonâ€™t be a bottleneck.

            <img id="myImg5" src="assets/Pics/pic5.png" alt="Cables: These cables can allow us to connect all wired devices together and allows them to be in different rooms. These cables are long enough to go around the house and they can allow very high transfer speeds which is perfect for the family that needs lots of bandwidth for their LAN.

            <img id="myImg6" src="assets/Pics/pic6.png" alt="Network Adapters: This supports gigabit transfer speeds which is higher than what the plan provides so this will allow the computer plenty of leeway and room to support the standard. This will allow the PCs upstairs to connect to the switch via ethernet. This card is also very cheap which is perfect for the penny pinching family.

This printer will be connected to the system via wifi to free up ethernet requirements and because this allows wireless devices to print instead of just ethernet connected devices." style="width:100%;max-width:500px" onclick="clicktest(this)">
