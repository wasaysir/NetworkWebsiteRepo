                <b>ROUTER AND NETWORK SETUP:</b><br>

<b>Step 1</b> – Connect the main router to the modem using an ethernet cable.
<br>
Most ISPs today combine a modem and a router into one device. This way you can just plug in your computer and it all works. But the provided modem/router is really slow, so we need to disable the router function of the ISP’s modem/router. The most common pre-set IP adress is 192.168.1.1, but changing this is ideal.
<br><br>
<b>Step 2</b> – Connect the office laptop to the main router.
<br>
Connect them using an ethernet cable.
<br><br>
<b>Step 3</b> – Change your IP adress and DHCP.
<br>
To change the IP address and DHCP, just press the Windows key and type CMD. Click on Command Prompt to open the terminal. Type the following, and press enter:
                <br></p>
<code id="instructables">ipconfig</code>
<p id="instructables"><br>
Copy the Default Gateway IP into your browser, and login to your ISP’s website. Go to the IP/DHCP settings and configure it to your choosing, following the basic IP format.
<br><br>
<b>Step 4</b> – Connect the switch
<br>
Unplug the ethernet cable between the laptop and router. Put the cable between a LAN port of the main router and the input on the switch. 
<br><br>
<b>Step 5</b> – Connect new router.
<br>
Connect an ethernet cable between the switch to the WAN port of the new router. Connect the laptop to the new router using an ethernet cable, connecting it directly into the LAN port of the new router.
<br><br>
<b>Step 6</b> – Configure the new router.
<br>
Using the laptop and your ISP’s webpage, connect the router.
<br><br>
<b>Step 7</b> – Disconnect the two new routers.
<br>
Repeat the last three steps with the third router.
<br><br>
<b>Step 8</b> – Connect wireless access points
    <br>            
The placement of the access point is really important, placing it in the right location makes all the difference in a good Wi-Fi connection or not. In your family’s case, the best place to put them is in bedroom 1 and the recreational room.
<br>
Once you have put them in the aforementioned rooms, connect them using the provided power cables to a wall outlet.
<br><br>
<b>Step 9</b> – Set-up a specific SSID and password for wireless devices
<br>
Using the laptop and your ISP’s webpage, go to the wireless settings and change the name and password to your choosing.
<br><br>
<b>SETUP FOR WIRELESS DEVICES (INCLUDES TVs, Phones, Laptops, Tablets):</b>
<br><br>
<b>Step 1</b> – Go to the wireless/Wi-Fi settings on your device.
<br><br>
Step 2 – Select the Wi-Fi name and enter password.
<br><br>
<b>SETUP FOR ETHERNET CONNECTIONS (INCLUDES Printer, Laptops):</b>
<br><br>
<b>Step 1</b> – Connect the device using an ethernet cable. You can choose to connect the other end into any of the LAN ports found on the routers or on the switch.
<br><br>
<b>SETUP FOR DESKTOP COMPUTERS:</b>
<br><br>
<b>Step 1</b> – Make sure the computer is shut-off and the back cable is no longer connected.
<br><br>
<b>Step 2</b> – Unscrew any screws holding the right-side panel of the case and slide off.
<br><br>
<b>Step 3</b> – Unscrew the PCIe panel from the backside of the case where the 1xPCIe slot is found.
<br><br>
<b>Step 4</b> – Insert the new NIC, and make sure there is a click.
<br><br>
<b>Step 5</b> – Line up the card with the screw hole, and screw it in place using the old screw.
<br><br>
<b>Step 6</b> – Close the panel and tighten the screws.
<br><br>
<b>Step 7</b> – Connect the new ethernet port using an ethernet cable, and connect the other end to the wireless access point.
<br><br>    
<b>Step 8</b> – Plug in the power cable and turn on the desktop.
